# Obsidian LLM Shortcut Plugin

A plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that provides a way to create shortcuts for commands powered by LLM capabilities.

## Why

The idea behind this plugin is very simple. I needed a way to manage prompts conveniently, without copy-pasting my stuff here and there.

The plugin allows you to create a directory of prompts that would automatically be mapped to Obsidian "commands" (tree-like structure would become an easily accessible list). The plugin will use the current open document as context for the selected prompt to an LLM provider of your choice.

So, this file-tree:

Becomes a list of commands:

## Example

Probably the best way to explain the workflow is via this little vid I made:
