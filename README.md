# Obsidian LLM Shortcut Plugin

A plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that provides a way to create shortcuts for commands powered by LLM capabilities.

## Why

The idea behind this plugin is very simple. I needed a way to manage prompts conveniently, without copy-pasting my stuff here and there.

The plugin allows you to create a directory of prompts that would automatically be mapped to Obsidian "commands" (tree-like structure would become an easily accessible list). The plugin will use the current open document as context for the selected prompt to an LLM provider of your choice.

## Features

- ðŸ¤– Multi-Provider Support: Works with any OpenAI-compatible API provider
- ðŸ”’ Privacy respected, nothing is stored or logged outside of your machine
- ðŸ“š Prompt Library: Organize prompts in a folder structure
- ðŸ”¥ Instant Commands: Your prompts transform into Obsidian commands

## Example

Probably the best way to explain the workflow is via this little vid I made:
